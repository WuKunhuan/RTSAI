# 2. University Governance

University Governance

The University of Hong Kong is incorporated under a Hong Kong Ordinance (Chapter 1053 of 1964). The Ordinance defines in general outline the University's powers and duties, the privileges, and the constitution, and may be amended only by the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. It provides for the making of Statutes. The Statutes, which the University itself makes, repeals, and amends, set out in detail important constitutional and procedural matters. Supplementary to these are the regulations, which provides in close detail for the orderly conduct of the University's day-to-day affairs.

The Ordinance and Statutes also provide for the machinery of government, setting out the officers and bodies in whom all power rest and upon whom all duties devolve. The main bodies for which the Ordinance and Statutes provide are the Court, the Council, the Senate and the Boards of the Faculties. Of these, only the Council and Senate are given power by the Ordinance to make regulations. All of these bodies may form committees and delegate their powers as they see fit.

The University follows international best practice in regularly reviewing its governance (as well as management) structure. The most recent review was conducted during 2002-03, following a key recommendation of the University Grants Committee's Higher Education Review (2002) that the governing body of each institution should review the fitness for purpose of its governance and management structures. The University's review was undertaken by an independent panel of international experts, and its report entitled Fit for Purpose was adopted for implementation by the Council in April 2003. Apart from a small number of recommendations that constitute the University's ongoing reform of governance (and management), most of the recommendations have been implemented. The inaugural meetings of the reconstituted Council and Senate were both held in December 2003. A Guide and Code of Practice for Members of the Council has also been published to help enhance the transparency and accountability of the governing body and conform to the highest standard of corporate governance.

# 3. University History

The Early Years

The University of Hong Kong (or HKU, as it is familiarly known to students, staff and alumni) is the oldest tertiary education institution in Hong Kong.

On March 16, 1910, Sir Frederick Lugard, the then Governor of Hong Kong, laid the foundation stone for the University.

The University was first incorporated in Hong Kong as a self-governing body of scholars by the University Ordinance on March 30, 1911.

On March 11, 1912, the University was officially opened, and Arts, Engineering and Medicine would become its first Faculties. The Faculty of Medicine evolved from the Hong Kong College of Medicine, founded in 1887. Of the College's early alumni, the most renowned was Dr Sun Yat-sen, often regarded as the founder of modern China.

In December 1916, the University held its first congregation, with just 23 graduates.

It was ten years after the founding of HKU that women students were admitted for the first time.

In 1937, Queen Mary Hospital opened and has served as the University's teaching hospital since then. Before the outbreak of the Second World War, which would bring academic activities to a halt, there were four Faculties - Arts, Engineering, Medicine, and Science.

After 1945, the University underwent structural developments as post-war reconstruction efforts began in earnest.

# 4. University Today

Today, HKU has gained international recognition for its accomplishments as a research-led comprehensive university.

In 2003, during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), HKU medical researchers became the first in the world to identify the coronavirus that caused the SARS.

In 2005, the Faculty of Medicine was renamed the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine.

From 2010 to 2012, the University held Centenary Celebrations to mark its 100th anniversary.

In 2012 – along with all the other institutions of higher learning in Hong Kong and in accordance with the government’s education policy – the University officially launches its 4-year undergraduate curriculum.

HKU continues to attract the best local students, along with many Mainland China and international students. The University’s academics have outstanding achievements in teaching and research, and about half of HKU’s faculty are from overseas. In 2023, 90 scholars joined HKU's academic staff ranks by the start of the first semester.

All ten faculties and their departments provide teaching and supervision for postgraduate-level research (MPhil and PhD) students, with administration undertaken by the Graduate School.

# 5. University Introduction

The University of Hong Kong, founded in 1911, is the oldest tertiary institution in Hong Kong. It was granted a shield and a motto by the College of Arms in 1913, and throughout its history the University's visual identity has been firmly based on their display, often coupled the University's name. This is a distinction that resonates outside Hong Kong, particularly in the United Kingdom, other Commonwealth jurisdictions, and the United States. It is also a reminder of the University's antiquity, and a most dignified and effective corporate identity.

The aim of this website is to encourage consistency in the use of the University of Hong Kong's name and visual identity. Consistent and scrupulous use of this visual identity helps to preserve the University's image as an institution that cherishes excellence, and helps to project its core common values.

The University's Visual Identity combines the University's shield and motto and the University's name in English ("The University of Hong Kong") and Chinese ("香港大學"). As it serves as the University's official identity, it should be used discreetly and respectfully.
