To install Python 3.12, you can visit the [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) page and follow the instructions for your operating system.

If you have an earlier version of Python installed and want to use Python 3.12, you can use `pyenv` (for Unix-like systems) or `pyenv-win` (for Windows) to manage multiple Python versions on your system.

#### Using pyenv (Unix-like systems)

1. Install `pyenv` by following the instructions provided in the [pyenv GitHub repository](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation).

2. Once `pyenv` is installed, you can install Python 3.12 by running the following command in your terminal: 

```pyenv install 3.12.0```

3. Set Python 3.12 as the global version by running the following in the terminal:

```pyenv global 3.12.0```

#### Using pyenv-win (Windows)

1. Install pyenv-win by following the instructions provided in the pyenv-win GitHub repository.

2. After installing pyenv-win, open a new command prompt and install Python 3.12 by running the following command in your Powershell:

```pyenv install 3.12.0```

3. Set Python 3.12 as the global version by running the following in the Powershell:

```pyenv global 3.12.0```
