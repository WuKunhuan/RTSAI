Usage: RTSAI chat [options] [arguments]

Description:
The `RTSAI chat` command allows you to interact with the RTSAI agent and manage knowledge graphs in the current environment.

Options: 
--load: If included, only one previous chat can be specified to load. If not included, a new chat with the name specified right after "RTSAI chat" will be generated. 
--graph: One or more graphs can be specified. Use this option to specify specific knowledge graphs the agent knows. If not included, all the knowledge graphs available will be used. 
--learn: Allows the RTSAI agent to update the knowledge graphs permanently.

Examples:
1. Create a new chat:
RTSAI chat <chat_name>
2. Load a specific previous chat:
RTSAI chat --load <chat_name>
3. Create a new chat with specific knowledge graph(s) loaded. 
RTSAI chat <chat_name> --graph <graph_name1> <graph_name2> ...
4. Load a chat with specific knowledge graph(s) loaded, and allow the agent to learn by modifying the selected knowledge graph <graph_name1>. 
RTSAI chat --graph <graph_name1> --load <chat_name>
5. Check out all the knowledge graphs available for the current environment. 
RTSAI env list --graph
6. Check out all the knowledge graphs available for a chat under the current environment (the chat must exist). The return includes both the knowledge graphs shared by the environment and the graphs only for this chat. 
RTSAI chat list --graph <chat_name>

Note: 
1. The options (--load, --graph, --learn) can be used in any order and can be mixed together. However, if --load is not included, then the argument after "RTSAI chat" will be the new chat created under the current environment. 
2. Replace <chat_name> and <graph_name> with the actual names of chats and knowledge graphs in your specific environment.
